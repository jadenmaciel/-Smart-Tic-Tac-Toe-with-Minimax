# âœ… Tic-Tac-Toe Project Task List

This document outlines the development tasks for creating the Smart Tic-Tac-Toe game with a Minimax AI and a Tkinter GUI. Tasks are ordered chronologically.

-----

### Phase 1: Core Game Logic & AI (`tictactoe_logic.py`)

  - [x] **1. Setup Project Structure:**

      - [x] Create a project directory.
      - [x] Create empty files: `main.py` and `tictactoe_logic.py`.

  - [x] **2. Implement the `TicTacToe` Class:**

      - [x] Create a class `TicTacToe` in `tictactoe_logic.py`.
      - [x] Initialize a 3x3 board (e.g., `self.board = [['' for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]`).
      - [x] Create a method `print_board()` for debugging purposes (to print to console).
      - [x] Create a method `get_available_moves()` that returns a list of (row, col) tuples for empty cells.

  - [x] **3. Implement Game-Over Conditions:**

      - [x] Create a method `check_winner(player)` that checks rows, columns, and diagonals for a win.
      - [x] Create a method `is_draw()` that checks if the board is full with no winner.

  - [x] **4. Implement the Minimax Algorithm:**

      - [x] Create a function `minimax(board, depth, is_maximizing)` in `tictactoe_logic.py`.
      - [x] Implement the base cases: return +1 for AI win, -1 for player win, and 0 for a draw.
      - [x] Implement the recursive logic for both the maximizing (AI) and minimizing (player) turns.

  - [x] **5. Create AI Move Function:**

      - [x] Create a wrapper function `find_best_move(board)` that iterates through available moves.
      - [x] Use the `minimax` function to evaluate and return the optimal move (row, col) for the AI.

-----

### Phase 2: Graphical User Interface (`main.py`)

  - [x] **1. Setup the Main Window:**

      - [x] Import `tkinter` and the logic from `tictactoe_logic.py`.
      - [x] Create the main `Tk` window and set its title and size.

  - [x] **2. Create the Game Board UI:**

      - [x] Create a `tk.Frame` to contain the grid.
      - [x] Create and arrange a 3x3 grid of `tk.Button` widgets.
      - [x] Style the buttons (font, size, etc.) for a good appearance.

  - [x] **3. Implement Player Interaction:**

      - [x] Create a function `on_button_click(row, col)`.
      - [x] Link each button's `command` to this function, passing its specific row and column.
      - [x] Inside the function, update the board state and the button's text ('X').
      - [x] Add logic to prevent clicking on an already-filled square.

  - [x] **4. Integrate the AI:**

      - [x] After the player's move, call the `find_best_move()` function.
      - [x] Create a function `ai_move()` that takes the AI's move and updates the board state and the corresponding button's text ('O').
      - [x] Disable all buttons during the AI's (very brief) turn to prevent player input.

  - [x] **5. Add Game Status and Controls:**

      - [x] Add a `tk.Label` to display game status (e.g., "Your Turn", "AI Wins").
      - [x] Add a "Restart" `tk.Button`.
      - [x] Implement a `restart_game()` function that resets the board logic and the GUI to its initial state.

-----

### Phase 3: Documentation & Finalization

  - [x] **1. Code Review and Refactoring:**

      - [x] Review all code for clarity, efficiency, and bugs.
      - [x] Add comments where necessary to explain complex parts.
      - [x] Ensure consistent coding style.

  - [x] **2. Create Documentation:**

      - [x] Write a comprehensive `README.md` file explaining the project, features, and how to run it.
      - [x] Write this `TASK.md` file to document the development process.

  - [x] **3. Final Testing:**

      - [x] Play through the game multiple times to ensure the AI is unbeatable.
      - [x] Test all edge cases (e.g., winning on the last move, immediate restart).
      - [x] Confirm the UI is responsive and provides clear feedback.
